# My European Travels
This is a simple shinyapp that shows places I've been to in Europe. I made a spreadsheet of cities with latitudes and longitudes, saved it as a csv, and imported it. The leaflet package is used to render the map.

## Libraries used
```
library(leaflet)
library(shiny)
library(sp)
```
## Current Status
The app is currently hosted [here](https://c-weave.shinyapps.io/eurotravels/).
